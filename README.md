# excel_to_dataframe
C++ Library to convert Excel worksheets to Pandas (folder python) or Microsoft (folder csharp) dataframes.

This software is in testing phase.

Feel free to test it out. If you want to share your experience, send me an email (nbittencourt@hotmail.com).

# Performance (python test only):
On an old processor (Intel Core i7-4510U 2.60 GHz, 4 cores) and with 8Gb RAM, the dll was between 12 and 25 times faster than Pandas.
