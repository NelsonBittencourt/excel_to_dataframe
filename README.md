# excel_to_dataframe
C++ Library to convert Excel worksheets to Pandas (folder python) or Microsoft (folder csharp) dataframes (Windows only).

This software is in testing phase.

Feel free to test it out. If you want to share your experience, send me an email (nbittencourt@hotmail.com).

# Performance (python test only):
On an old processor (Intel Core i7-4510U 2.60 GHz, 4 cores) and with 8Gb RAM, the dll was between 5 and 20 times faster than Pandas.

# How it works:
Under construction.

# Python installation (Windows and Linux):

## PyPI:
```Python
pip install excel-to-dataframe==0.2.54
```
